In the ci mode, 
I am thinking that in addition to the writes, 
we should have multiple other threads 
that are trying to read product information 
while the writing is going 
like multiple readers to really demonstrate 
this cqrs action and its benefits 
I have added the latest source code in dump.txt 
always closely read the dump.txt as it has the FULL Source code. 
never skim it, 
never search it, 
never get portions of it. 
always read the full dump.txt because you need the full context every time. 
use your best judgment. 
always use the latest dotnet standard and follow industry best practices. we want everything to be as perfect as possible. 
don't assume just because code is a certain way, we want it that way. always use best practices like primary constructor, readonly modifier, and so on 
please give clear and comprehensive answer if my assumptions are incorrect 
and please read the full `dump.txt` and give your response based on that 
don't skim it, don't search it, don't extract from it. 
read the whole thing end to end. 
take your time. 
and then give me a response 
the response must have FULL files for easy copy pasting. 
please and thank you 
avoid adding new nuget packages unless necessary 
if we need to add nuget packages 
avoid non-free nuget packages 
so avoid things like MediatR
always get the latest versions of nuget packages 
and make the code work for that
