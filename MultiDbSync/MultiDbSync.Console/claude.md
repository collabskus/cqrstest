This is great progress. 
It builds great. 
When I switch to warning in appsettings, the output is gorgeous. 
Also we use mediatR 12.2.0 for which there is no update path. 
lets get rid of it and do this ourselves without any dependency. 
add polly if you need to 
but please get rid of mediatR
please give full files for all the files that need to change for this 
please and thank you 
remember, this is dotnet 10, not dotnet 9. 
also notice mediatR is only in the console project 
so removing it should not involve anything other than this console csproj 
and maybe files in the console project. 
please give clear and comprehensive answer if my assumptions are incorrect 
and please read the full `dump.txt` and give your response based on that 
don't skim it, don't search it, don't extract from it. 
read the whole thing end to end. 
take your time. 
and then give me a response 
the response must have FULL files for easy copy pasting. 
please and thank you
